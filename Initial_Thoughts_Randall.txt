	- decide how to host the website
	- create a database to store the information required
	- create the login interface and then the create profile page (this is similar to registration)

	- a dashboard for profile, fuel quote history, price model
	- create the history page and the model page


2: We have elected to use the Rapid Application Development methodology
	- we decided to do this because it was a straight forward methodology that fits are needs well
	- we are first defining our project requirements 
	- then creating a prototype 
	- and then building more off that 
	- it fits well with the future assignments as well
